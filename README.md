## 🔍 Project Overview
- **Objective**: Optimize the placement of a grid within a triangle by rotating and shifting the grid to maximize or minimize the number of points inside the triangle.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Geometric Algorithms**: Utilizes advanced algorithms to rotate points and check point inclusion within a triangle.
  - **Interactive Visualization**: Employs `matplotlib` for dynamic visualizations, allowing users to interact with the grid and triangle using sliders.
  - **Optimization**: Implements techniques to find the optimal grid placement, enhancing computational efficiency.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language for the project.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and grid manipulations.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating interactive plots and visualizations.
