## üîç Project Overview
- **Objective**: Optimize the placement of a grid within a triangle by rotating and shifting the grid to maximize or minimize the number of points inside the triangle.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Geometric Algorithms**: Utilizes advanced algorithms to rotate points and check point inclusion within a triangle.
  - **Interactive Visualization**: Employs `matplotlib` for dynamic visualizations, allowing users to interact with the grid and triangle using sliders.
  - **Optimization**: Implements techniques to find the optimal grid placement, enhancing computational efficiency.

# Main Methodology

In this study, we examine the optimal placement of a grid frame within a random scalene triangle. The process involves the following steps:

1. **Triangle Design**:
   - We create a random scalene triangle with side lengths L.
   - The triangle is defined by its vertices in a Cartesian coordinate system.

2. **Grid Frame Definition**:
   - We define a grid frame with a spacing of 1x1 meter for each node.
   - The grid is initially placed with a random angle and vertical shift.

3. **Optimal Placement Search**:
   - We rotate the grid by 360¬∞ with a step of 1¬∞.
   - We shift the grid vertically with a step of 0.1 meter.
   - For each combination of angle and shift, we calculate the number of grid nodes that lie within the triangle.
   - We record the angle and shift that yield the maximum number of nodes within the triangle.

4. **Improvement Factor Calculation**:
   - We calculate the improvement factor as the percentage increase in the number of nodes compared to the initial placement.
