# Project Overview
- **Objective**: Optimize the placement of a grid within a triangle by rotating and shifting the grid to maximize or minimize the number of points inside the triangle.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Geometric Algorithms**: Utilizes advanced algorithms to rotate points and check point inclusion within a triangle.
  - **Interactive Visualization**: Employs `matplotlib` for dynamic visualizations, allowing users to interact with the grid and triangle using sliders.
  - **Optimization**: Implements techniques to find the optimal grid placement, enhancing computational efficiency.

### üåç Real-World Applications

This project has direct applications in optimizing land field layouts, which can significantly enhance agricultural planning, land surveying, and resource management. By increasing the efficiency of grid placements, we can better utilize space and improve overall productivity.

#### Agricultural Planning
Optimizing land field layouts can lead to more efficient use of agricultural land. This can result in:
- **Higher Crop Yields**: By maximizing the use of available space, farmers can plant more crops and increase their yields.
- **Reduced Waste**: Efficient layouts minimize unused or poorly utilized areas, reducing waste and improving overall land use.
- **Improved Irrigation**: Better planning can lead to more effective irrigation systems, ensuring that water is distributed evenly and efficiently across the fields.

# Main Methodology
In this study, we examine the optimal placement of a grid frame within a random scalene triangle. The process involves the following steps:

1. **Triangle Design**:
   - User creates a random scalene triangle.
   - The triangle is defined by its vertices in a Cartesian coordinate system.

2. **Grid Frame Definition**:
   - We define a grid frame with a spacing of nxn meter for each node.
   - The grid is initially placed with a random angle and vertical shift.

3. **Optimal Placement Search**:
   - We rotate the grid by 90¬∞ with a step of 1¬∞.
   - We shift the grid vertically with a step of 0.1 meter.
   - For each combination of angle and shift, we calculate the number of grid nodes that lie within the triangle.
   - We record the angle and shift that yield the maximum number of nodes within the triangle.


4. **Improvement Factor Calculation**:
   - We calculate the improvement factor as the percentage increase in the number of nodes compared to the initial placement.
   - Calculate the improvement factor using the formula:


  $$\text{Improvement Factor} = \left(\frac{\text{Max Points} - \text{Average Points of Random Position}}{\text{Average Points of Random Position}}\right) \times 100$$
